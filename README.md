theme-expanse
=============

The official repository for our default theme, Expanse. Fork this to use it as a boilerplate.

## Getting Started

This theme uses LESS for CSS precompiling, and it uses Gulp for compiling the LESS into CSS, and also for concatenating and minifying JavaScript files.

_Note: You do not need LESS and Gulp to use this theme, you can just edit the CSS directly if you like. LESS and Gulp are for advanced users._

### 1) Install Node Modules

Run the following command in Terminal to install Gulp for LESS preprocessing.
```
npm install
```

### 2) Run Gulp

Run gulp to make sure all CSS and JavaScript files are the latest versions.
```
gulp
```
